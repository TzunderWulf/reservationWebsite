# Reservation System
This is a website to make a reservation for a garage. It was made during the second CLE block of year 1.
The website includes validation for the forms and an overview for our client.

The project was written in PHP, as well as CSS (for styling).

For validation of license plates it uses a library (made by divtag-nl). The validation for phone numbers is written with 
the code and for email-addresses we use the filter_var function of php.

Once a reservation is made a confirmation email is send, which includes the date and time.
